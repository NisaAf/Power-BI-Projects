2) Customer Segmentation
   Datasource - [AdventureWorksDW](https://dataedo.com/samples/html/Data_warehouse/doc/AdventureWorksDW_4/home.html)
   The Customer Segmentation Dashboard leverages RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to transform raw transactional data into a powerful strategic tool for understanding customer value. By analyzing three critical dimensions—how recently a customer has purchased, how often they buy, and how much they spend—the dashboard creates a comprehensive visualization that segments customers into distinct groups like Champions, Potential Loyalists, and At-Risk customers. This interactive platform enables businesses to quickly identify high-value customers, detect potential churn risks, and develop targeted marketing strategies that optimize customer engagement and maximize revenue potential. Through color-coded heatmaps, dynamic metrics panels, and actionable insights, the dashboard provides a clear, data-driven approach to understanding and improving customer relationships.
